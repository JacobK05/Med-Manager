 # Project Name 
  Medication-Manager 
  
  
# User Story
As a person who takes medications or a person who manages medications for a family member,

I want to manage my med's and/or my family memberâ€™s med's easily without a pill box,

So that I can take them/give them on time and consistently.


## Description
For this project, my group members and I thought of an idea that would solve the problem of forgetting to take your medication or taking it late. We built a web application that allows you to create an account. which then lets you input the med's that you need to take along with dosage, frequency, description of med, and any other extra notes. With these inputs, the user will get a list of all the information that they provided for each med. The website also allows you to mark the taken med's as completed, with an option to edit and delete a med. The end goal of the web app is to solve the problem of ever forgetting to take your medication or even forgetting to give medication to a family member. To keep you and your family healthy. Along the way, my group and I learned how important working as a team is and what good communication can do.
